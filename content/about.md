# About Celeborn Research

This is a private research repository maintained for internal use by an institutional credit investment office.

**Focus:** Opportunistic credit in digital infrastructure — data centers, power generation, and GPU-backed lending.

**Approach:** Credit investor mindset. Skeptical of consensus narratives. Every claim backed by specific data points. Physical reality over financial abstraction.

**Contact:** celeborn.research@gmail.com
