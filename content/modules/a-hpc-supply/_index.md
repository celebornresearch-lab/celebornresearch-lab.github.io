# Module A: Triangulating HPC Supply (The Hardware Constraint)

**Status:** ⏳ Queued

*← Back to [Master Thesis](/thesis/)*

---

## Objective

Build a bottoms-up supply model to verify if projected AI growth is physically possible.

### Sections (planned)
- A.1 — Silicon Supply Chain (TSMC wafers, HBM memory, efficiency gains Hopper → Blackwell → Rubin)
- A.2 — The Neocloud Ecosystem (equity flows, off-take terms, take-or-pay structures)
- A.3 — Chip Allocation (Foundation Model Labs vs. Enterprise vs. Nation States)
