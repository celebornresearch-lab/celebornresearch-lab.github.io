# Module B: Triangulating HPC Demand (The Economic Utility)

**Status:** ⏳ Queued

*← Back to [Master Thesis](/thesis/)*

---

## Objective

Determine if there is real ROI backing the capex, or if this is a bubble.

### Sections (planned)
- B.1 — Training Demand (cluster size history, GW cluster timeline)
- B.2 — Inference Demand (enterprise vs. consumer adoption, 1:1 human/AI compute proxy)
- B.3 — The Efficiency Question (if agents become efficient, do we need less compute?)
- B.4 — Hyperscaler Balance Sheets (internal use vs. cloud sales, equity-for-compute structures)
