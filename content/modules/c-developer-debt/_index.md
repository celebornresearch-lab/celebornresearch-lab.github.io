# Module C: Developer Debt & DC Credit Analysis

**Status:** 🔨 In Progress — Pulling SEC filings and building the master debt table.

*← Back to [Master Thesis](/thesis/)*

---

## Objective

Identify credit risks in the physical infrastructure buildout by mapping every known debt issuance, lease obligation, and project finance structure across the public DC developer universe.

---

## Sections (building)

### C.1 — Developer Universe: Debt & Facility Map
*The master table: company × data center × borrowing instrument.*

Coming soon — pulling from 10-K/10-Q/8-K filings.

### C.2 — Lease Structure Analysis
*Termination for convenience, failure-to-deliver clauses, tenant walk-away risk.*

### C.3 — Construction & Delivery Risk
*GPU lead times (months) vs. DC build times (years). The mismatch that creates credit events.*

### C.4 — Power & Grid Constraints
*Grid queues, behind-the-meter realities, CapEx for non-IT infrastructure.*

### C.5 — Asset Life & Obsolescence
*15-year leases vs. useful life vs. cooling/power density evolution.*
