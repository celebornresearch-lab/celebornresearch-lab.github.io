# Module D: Pricing the Tail Risks (The Synthesis)

**Status:** ⏳ Queued

*← Back to [Master Thesis](/thesis/)*

---

## Objective

Quantify the disconnect between market pricing and reality through rigorous scenario analysis.

### Sections (planned)
- D.1 — The "Post-Scarcity" Shock (labor displacement, deflationary pressure, asset price implications)
- D.2 — The "Stall" Scenario (scaling law failure, hyperscaler capex cuts, NVDA revenue cliff)
- D.3 — The "Obsolescence" Risk (100x efficiency gains, DC demand collapse, credit contraction feedback loop)
- D.4 — Scenario Matrix (probability-weighted outcomes for asset values and debt serviceability)
