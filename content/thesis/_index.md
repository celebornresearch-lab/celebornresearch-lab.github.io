# AI Infrastructure Credit Dislocation

**Status:** In Progress — Module C (Developer Debt & DC Credit Analysis) underway.

---

## The Thesis

AI is a disruptive force that will displace labor and force economic readjustment. The market views this purely as a productivity boom and is mispricing the tail risks: social disruption, regulatory backlash, and deflationary pressure.

**The Opportunity:** Opportunistic credit entry points in digital infrastructure and power that emerge from this dislocation — financing physical assets with secondary market value (power generation, completed data centers) where traditional lenders are too slow or risk-averse.

**The Null Hypothesis:** *"The market is currently pricing edge risks in AI infrastructure and adoption fairly."*

Our goal is to rigorously challenge and potentially disprove this hypothesis.

## The Credit Lens

This research is written from the perspective of an opportunistic credit investor. Every module is tested against:

1. **What is the downside?** — Collateral value, recovery rates, structural subordination
2. **What breaks first?** — Weakest links in the capital structure chain
3. **Where is the secondary value?** — Physical assets that retain value in dislocation scenarios (power, shells, land, fiber)
4. **What are others missing?** — Information asymmetry between public market pricing and physical reality

Data centers and their associated power infrastructure are identifiable, recoverable assets. In a dislocation, mispriced debt backed by these assets creates the credit bid opportunity.
